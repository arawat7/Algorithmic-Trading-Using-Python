
This is the implementation of a traditional simple moving average(SMA) cross-over strategy. This strategy generates a buy signal when a fast moving average(30 days) crossover a slow moving averag (100 days) and generates a sell signal when a fast moving average(30 days) cross-under a slow moving average(100 days).

Out of the 5 signals generated, this strategy was profitable on 4 occasions. However, this strategy needs to be backtested on more data and needs to be optimized further.
